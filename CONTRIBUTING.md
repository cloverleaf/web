## Setting up the dev environment

* Fork the **dev branch** and clone it locally.
* Run `npm install` to make sure you have all the dependancies installed.
* Start dev work 


## Style

For js we try to stick to [standard style](https://standardjs.com/)
For commits use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), this is to make sure commits are machine readable
