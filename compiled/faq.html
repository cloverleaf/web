<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is this and why should I use it?:</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is a complete redesign of the traditional password generator/storage system. Instead of relying on a hard drive to not to fail, or that backup you keep forgetting to make, Perdola makes a password based on your master password and the application you want a password for. This generated password will be the same every time, no matter what device you&#39;re on. You can then copy this and paste it into the app you want to log into.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I know you&#39;re not looking at my passwords?:</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> When you type, your computer takes the app name and your master password and using them makes a new password. Nothing is ever sent across the internet, other than the code for the website itself. If you really want, you can <a href="https://github.com/ChildishGiant/perdola">download the files</a> for the website, smash your router and run Perdola offline (Not that I&#39;d recommend smashing your router.)</p>
<p><a name="remake"><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you remake an existing product?:</a></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I&#39;ve openly acknowledged that Perdola is based off the concept of &quot;<a href="https://masterpasswordapp.com/">Master Password</a>&quot; but why would I spend all this time re-making a working piece of software? The answer is simple: <em>I don&#39;t like how master password works.</em> It has many different offshoots that all look different. It takes 6 variables to make a password and 30 seconds to load (Yes, I timed it.). It makes everything harder than it should be. And that was my motivation to make Perdola. I absolutely love the concept of secure passwords without storing them but hate the current solutions.</p>
