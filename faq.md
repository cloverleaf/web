**Q:** How do I know you're not looking at my passwords?:

**A:** When you hit submit, your computer takes the app name and your master password and using them makes a new password. Nothing is ever sent across the internet, other than the code for the website itself. If you really want, you can [download the files](https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola) for the website, smash your router and run Perdola offline (Not that I'd recommend smashing your router.)

If you want to be sure I'm not phishing for passwords or anything like that, you can read through all the [code on github](https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola).
